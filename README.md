-> This project in c language of snake game is a simple console application. 
-> In this project, I have implemented the popular “snake game”.
-> Some Basic Information:-
    you have to use the up, down, right or left arrows to move the snake. 
    Foods are provided at the several co-ordinates of the screen for the snake to eat. 
    Every time when the snake eats the food, its length will be increased by one element along with the score.

-> Analysis:-
   System has been analysed several times. Overall it has worked well to play the game inside the given border line Some problems have been reported 
   and corrected on time.
    Object of the project: -
      1. prints the game information.
      2. making a border function.
      3. making a snake body.
      4. Give the food function.
      6. Insert the score and life function.
      5. Insert the player name and print the score
    Prints the game information: -
      Here all the game information will print and the
      Game instructions about how to play the game and
      How to control the snake etc.
    Making a border function: -
      First clear the system screen.
      Give some coordinates using gotoxy function.
      Using for loop print all the upper x coordinates and
      Print(!) using printf function.
      And do the same for all the four coordinates.
      Making a snake body
      food will be provided the snake in each and coordinates
      using gotoxy (food.x, food. y) and in the shape of ‘F’ will be
      printed using printf function.
    Insert the player name and check the score
      When the game gets over it will ask to print the player
      Name and after printing it will show the player name.
    Now we will again go to the menu page.
 -> Thank You.
